# Password-Setup-Prelim
# Description

    -I've created this Javascript to test my skills in the language, and generate a unique passwrod for users based on their perameters set.

    -The repo was made to query users about specifications(i.e. numbers, symbols, upper and lowercase letters ) to the password they wish to generate.


    -Password generation was the main intent of this page. Not to be coherent, but to be completely random. I aim to add other qualifications. For example using other languages, names, or other forms of nominclature to fit inside the spefications of the user in the future as I tweak this repository.


    -From this learning venture, I've found JavaScript to be daunting, but you have to keep going. The order and syntax of things are important, and remembering what goes where were extremely challenging.
